# HA_CR2.1A_BALASA_ANA_MARIA_REBECA

 Description

This project is developed in IntelliJ IDEA to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using three different algorithms: BFS (Breadth-First Search), Uniform Cost Search, and A* Search. This README provides instructions on how to download and run the project.

 Requirements

- IntelliJ IDEA: Download and install IntelliJ IDEA from the [official website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
- Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK installed. Check the `pom.xml` file for the correct version.
- Git Bash: Download and install Git Bash from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

   2.Run the Main class. The solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem will be executed  within the main method.

Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
   The project includes functionality to solve the TSP problem using the following algorithms:

   - BFS (Breadth-First Search)
   - Uniform Cost Search
   - A Search*

Ensure Data Input
   Make sure your input data for the TSP problem is correctly formatted and available in the Problem class.

Execute the TSP Solver
   The TSP solver will be executed as part of the main program.

Troubleshooting
   If you encounter any issues:

   - Ensure the JDK configuration is set correctly.
   - Check for errors in the source code and resolve them accordingly.
